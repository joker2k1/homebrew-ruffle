A Homebrew tap for the latest (`master`) version of Ruffle. As edgy as it gets.

## To do

- [x] Build from source like a good Homebrew formula
- [ ] Auto-download [latest](https://api.github.com/repos/ruffle-rs/ruffle/releases) nightly release as a bottle
  - [ ] Or update automatically with a GH Action triggered by ruffle-rs/ruffle new releases?

Inspired by [rust-nightly](https://github.com/pointlessone/homebrew-rust-nightly)
